For full subcategories the answer is affirmative. Makkai and Pitts proved that in the case \${\textbackslash}lambda={\textbackslash}aleph\_0\$ the answer is affirmative also for all iso-full subcategories, {\textbackslash}emph\{i.{\textbackslash}thinspace e.\}, those containing with every pair of objects all isomorphisms between them. We discuss a possible generalization of this from \${\textbackslash}aleph\_0\$ to an arbitrary \${\textbackslash}lambda\$.},
